### About This Game

Embrace mind-blowing moments as youâ€™re pulled deep into the many worlds of Split Fiction, a boundary-pushing co-op action adventure from the studio behind 2021 Game of the Year Winner, It Takes Two. Mio and Zoe are contrasting writers â€“ one writes sci-fi and the other writes fantasy â€“ who become trapped in their own stories after being hooked up to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas. Theyâ€™ll have to rely on each other to break free with their memories in-tact, working together to master a variety of abilities and overcome diverse challenges while jumping between sci-fi and fantasy worlds in this unexpected tale of friendship.

Split Fiction is a unique action-adventure experience that keeps you on the edge of your couch with unexpected moments. One minute youâ€™re taming adorable dragons and the next youâ€™re fighting as cyber ninjas, escaping terrifying trolls, or dodging hover cars thrown by a robotic parking attendant. Itâ€™s weird, itâ€™s wild, and itâ€™s designed to be shared.

Grab your co-op partner and get ready to overcome any obstacle thrown your way.
